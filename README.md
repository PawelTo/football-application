# football-application
Repository to create some football application.
The main reason to create such application is to improve my java and spring framework skills, which I had opportunity to get during my previous project - master degree thesis (also available on my git profile).

The main technology used in application are:
1. Simple CRUD application which enable users basic operations with PostgreSQL database - Spring Data
2. Frontend for users - HTML, JavaScrpt, Bootstrap, CSS and thymeleaf as template engine. (Frontend technology isn't main goal of that application, so I'm aware that it needs a lot of improvment, I hope I'll do this in nearest feature. 
3. Basic Java logging API - SLF4J

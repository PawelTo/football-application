# football-application
Repository to create some football application.
The main reason to create such application is to improve my java and spring framework skills, which I had opportunity to get during my previous project - master degree thesis (also available on my git profile).
What's more, I'm also aware that my project needs a lot of improvment, which I hope I'll do it in the near future, but the main goal of that application is get to know in the most popular technology and libraries. Next step I'm going to create that application more user friendly with real business functionality.

The main technology used in application are:
1. Simple CRUD application which enable users basic operations with PostgreSQL database - Spring Data
2. Preparing custom Query with JPQL and Native Query (using pure SQL)
3. Tests with JUnit and Mockito 
4. Frontend for users - HTML, JavaScrpt, Bootstrap, CSS and thymeleaf as template engine. (Frontend technology isn't main goal of that application, so I'm aware that it needs a lot of improvment, I hope I'll do this in nearest feature.
5. RestController to cooparate with JSON
6. Basic Java logging API - SLF4J
7. Feature to read data from file from supported formats: CSV, TXT, XLS, XLSX, XLSM - Apache POI library
8. Saving data to file in supported formats: CVS, TXT, XLSX
9. Sending emails - Spring-boot-starter-mail (it is necessary to configure your email account to send message)
10. Uploading file from selectecd path to created folder.
